Whether you're interested in data analytics, data engineering or data science this repository provides ample resources to get up to speed with the crucial, fundamental technologies and skills you'll need in any data career as well as diving deeper into more advanced techniques for those who wish to go further.

This is a purely voluntary hobby project from a handful of data analysts, data engineers and data scientists who are passionate about improving their skills and learning more about our fascinating industry.
